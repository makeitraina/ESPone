# ESPone

Pone the ESPN website to store useful sports data.

## What this project is about

I little while ago I found an amazing API provided by ESPN only to realize that it had been completely deprecated. Outraged at the lack of free sprots APIs, I set out to create a service that could use data from sports websites such as ESPN to create a private data set that can power various applications.

## What this project does

By running a quick command:

'''python runservice.py'''

This service will begin to actively accumulate and tag content from ESPN. The purpose of the service is to create a temporary unstructured set of information that can be consumed by other interfaces for immediate use or further persistence.
